<h3> 365 </h3>
<p> In 365 DAYS, Massimo (Michele Morrone, a model, actor, and singer who contributed songs to the soundtrack) is a tall, handsome, and brooding Sicilian gangster whose father was shot in front of his eyes. At that moment, he glimpsed Laura (Anna Maria Sieklucka) and became obsessed with finding her and making her fall in love with him. When he locates her, instead of wooing her, he drugs and kidnaps her, imprisons her, and tells her she has 365 days to fall in love with him. If she doesn't, he will let her go. She struggles to escape and he violently stops her, at times putting his large hand gruffly around her neck to keep her from running. He ominously warns her, "Don't provoke me," and notes that he doesn't tolerate "disobedience," suggesting that in his view, a kidnap victim ought to buckle to his orders and desires. At the same time, he "gallantly" promises never to do anything sexual without her permission, and then puts his hand on her breast and later slips his hand down her pants while she's tied up. Laura is a bundle of contradictions herself, walking around naked to tease him but also adamantly resistant to his advances. She tries to escape but is thwarted by bodyguards and police on the take. Eventually, she gives in to her lust for the towering Massimo, suggesting that, for all their protestations, women just want to be dominated by gruff alpha males. The film ends abruptly with a planned, unexplained murder, paving the way for a sequel. </p> <br />
<h3> After </h3>
<p> AFTER begins on the day that Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) is leaving home for college. Her mother, Carol (Selma Blair), is struggling to let go, especially when she meets her daughter's partying dorm roommate, but she's reassured because Tessa has always been responsible and hardworking. Tessa has also had the same boyfriend since she was a kid -- but that changes when she meets handsome, British-accented, poetry-reciting rebel Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The pair are set up in a Truth or Dare challenge at a raucous college party where the straitlaced Tessa feels woefully out of place. They bond, and then spar over their readings of classic novels. The more Tessa falls for Hardin and starts letting go of her rules and exploring her own desire, the more her structured world begins falling apart. </p>
<p> Despite a predictable storyline and clich√©d romance, After works, thanks in large part to the heartfelt performance of its young star, Josephine Langford. As Tessa, Langford appears in almost every scene, and with the camera regularly close in on her face, she conveys a sincere mix of self-restraint and hunger for new experiences, confidence and fragility. She's a credible college first-year student, and we believe her and feel for her as a young woman falling in love for the first time. What comes off as less authentic is the story's Pride and Prejudice-inspired romance, based on the cult One Direction fan fiction published by author Anna Todd on the site Wattpad and later as a book series.

The tale requires that Hardin appear to be both Tessa's opposite -- brooding, experienced, and rebellious, despite his father's top university post and wealth -- and also her equally vulnerable soulmate. Tiffin has the budding charisma and looks (he is a Fiennes, after all) to play the romantic lead, but his character here is contrived mostly as a device for Tessa's evolution. After is likely to attract a heavily female audience, but it could struggle to find its market. More mature viewers might find it too formulaic, while parents may keep younger teens away because of the explicit content. </p> <br />
<h3> Fifty Shades of Grey </h3>
<p> FIFTY SHADES OF GREY the movie -- like the best-selling erotic novel it's based on -- is a simple story: Virginal college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) must step in for her journalism major roommate, Kate, to interview 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), who's immediately taken with the soft-spoken brunette. After purposely bumping into her a couple more times, Christian reveals that he'd like Anastasia to sign a contract to engage in a dominant-submissive sexual relationship with him. But Anastasia, a virgin, has no idea what she's comfortable with until they start an intense sexual affair that makes both of them question everything they thought about relationships.
 </p>
<p> It's all relative, of course, but this movie is infinitely better than the poorly written book it's based on, which is a best-seller because of the naughty bits, rather than the prose. As expected, the script nixes some of the book's more cringe-inducing elements (no "inner goddess" or constant exclamations of "Geez") while staying faithful to the minimalist storyline. Johnson is actually quite good as Anastasia, giving her the right amount of vulnerability and curiosity, but Dornan is nothing more than scowling eye-candy. He doesn't have a commanding enough presence to be believable in his role, though at least he's got the brooding right. While the pair generates more heat than the negative press about them would suggest, it's not nearly enough to merit the third of the movie they spend having or talking about sex.

In fact, Fifty Shades of Grey's best moments have no nudity in them at all: an innuendo-filled conversation in the hardware store where Ana works, for example; or a silly drunken phone call; or the early part of a "business meeting" to negotiate what Anastasia will and won't do with Christian. The sex is shot in such extreme close-ups that audiences might find themselves unintentionally laughing at the contrast between Johnson's unwavering enthusiasm and Dornan's look of sheer boredom or disinterest. Devoted fans of James' trilogy will be thrilled to know that the studio has committed to making all three of the books into movies, while those who were expecting an utter disaster will have to settle for an "erotic movie" with a soundtrack that's sexier than its storyline.
